## Running the Dev Server

To run a local development server and view the kaleidoscope experience, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to start a Python HTTP server:

   ```
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/kaleidoscope.html
   ```

This will launch the kaleidoscope experience in your default web browser.
